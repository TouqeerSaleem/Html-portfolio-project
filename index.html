            well-maintained for the same purpose. Cricket is particularly famous in
            England and India. There is a lot of potential in Cricket which allows
            players to earn well. Cricket does not have one single format but

        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest technological evolution examples is that of what is
            seen in video games. Over the years there had been massive changes and
            several creations since the first released video game. Before the age of
            Playstation, Xbox, or even computer games, people used to be engrossed
            in playing video arcade games and later the 8-bit video games using
            consoles, joysticks, and other controllers. Now we have video games with
            much higher graphics, better storyline, and even more options. This
            makes the gaming experience more thrilling and enjoyable; however, it
            does not change the fact that video games have turned almost an entire
            generation into couch potatoes.</p>
